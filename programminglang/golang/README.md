##### Variable
- Variable Declaration
    - var foo int
    - var foo int = 42
    - foo := 42
- Redeclaration and Shadowing(overriding)
        - can not redeclare variables, but can shadow them
        - All variable must be used meaning, variable if used only be declared else not (built-in refactoring feature)
- Visibility
    - lower case first letter for package scope
    - upper case first letter to export
    - no private scope at all
- Naming Convention
    - Pascal or camelCase
        - Capitalize acronyms (HTTP, URL)
    - As short as reasonable
        - longer names for longer lives
- Type Conversions
    - destinationType(variable)
    - act as function conversion and convert in target value
    - use strconv package for strings conversion

##### Primitive
- Boolean Type
    - values are true or false
    - not an alias for other types(eg. int)
    - zero value is false
- Numeric Type
    - Integers
        - Signed Integer
            - int type has varying size, but min 32 bits
            - 8 bit(int8) through 64 bit(int64)
            - int8: 128 - 127
            - int16: 32768 - 32767
            - int32
            - int64
        - Unsigned Integer
            - 8bit(byte and uint8) through 32 bit(uint32)
            - uint8
            - uint16
            - uint32
        - Arithmetic Operator
            - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Reminder
        - Bitwise Operator
            - And, OR, XOR and NOT
        - zero value is zero
        - can't mix types in same family(uint64 + uint32= error)
    - Floating Point
        - Follow IEEE754 standard
        - zero value is 0
        - float32, float64
        - literal styles
            - decimal(3.45)
            - exponential(12e12 oe 2E10)
            - Mixed(13.7e12)
        - Arithmetic Operator
            - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
    - Complex Number
        - zero value is (0+0i)
        - complex64
        - complex128
        - built-in functions
            - complex - make complex number from two floats
            - real - get real part as float
            - imag - get imaginary part as float
- Text Type
    - Strings
        - utf-8
        - immutable
        - can be concatenated with plus(+) operator
        - can be converted to []byte
    - Rune
        - utf-32
        - alias for int32
        - special method normally required to process
            - eg. strings, Reader#ReadRune        
##### Constant
- Naming convention
- Typed constants
- Untyped constants
- Enumerated constants
- Enumerated expressions
