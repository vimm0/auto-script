# THE LINUX COMMAND LINE (Book)

## PART 1: LEARNING THE SHELL
- What Is the Shell?
    - [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html)
        - The GNU project includes an [operating system kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system_kernel), 
        [GNU Hurd ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd), which was the original focus of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). 
        However, given the Hurd kernel's status as not yet production-ready, non-GNU kernels, most popularly the 
        [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), can also be used with GNU software. The combination of GNU 
        and Linux has become ubiquitous to the point that the duo is often referred  to as just "Linux" in short, or, less 
        frequently, GNU/Linux. (see [the GNU/Linux naming controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy))
        - [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU)
    - [bash / Bourne Again Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) 
        - Bash is an enhanced replacement for [sh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) by Steve Bourne.
    - [Terminal Emulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)
    - shell prompt
        - format username@machinename
    - virtual terminals
        - access virtual terminal with CTRL - ALT -F1 through CTRL - ALT -F6 on most systems. When a session is accessed, it
        presents a login prompt into which we can enter our username and password.
        To switch from one virtual console to another, press ALT and F1 â€“ F6. To return
        to the graphical desktop, press ALT -F7.
