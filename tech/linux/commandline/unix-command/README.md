# THE LINUX COMMAND LINE (Book)

## PART 1: LEARNING THE SHELL
- What Is the Shell?
    - [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html)
        - The GNU project includes an [operating system kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system_kernel), 
        [GNU Hurd ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd), which was the original focus of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). 
        However, given the Hurd kernel's status as not yet production-ready, non-GNU kernels, most popularly the 
        [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), can also be used with GNU software. The combination of GNU 
        and Linux has become ubiquitous to the point that the duo is often referred  to as just "Linux" in short, or, less 
        frequently, GNU/Linux. (see [the GNU/Linux naming controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy))
