            - `bold <length> , thin`
        - Double ampersand(mandatory but may appear in any order.)
            - `bold && <length>`
        - Double bar(at least one of them must be present, and they may appear in any order.)
            - `<'border-width'> || <'border-style'> || <'border-color'>`
        - Single bar(exactly one of these options must be present.)
            - `<percentage> | <length> | left | center | right | top | bottom`
    - Component value multipliers(multiplier is a sign that indicate how many times a preceding entity can be repeated.)
        - Asterisk (*) (indicates that the entity may appear zero, one or several times.)

            - `bold smaller+`

            - `bold smaller?`

            - `bold smaller{1,3}`
        - Hash mark (#) (indicates that the entity may be repeated one or more times)
            - `bold smaller#`
