# Amazing Facts

## Linux vs Unix

- Linux is a UNIX Clone
  - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)
  - UNIX is copyrighted name only big companies are allowed to use the UNIX copyright and name, so IBM AIX and Sun Solaris and HP-UX all are UNIX operating systems.
  - The Open Group holds the UNIX trademark in trust for the industry, and manages the UNIX trademark licensing program.
- Linux Is Just a Kernel
  - All Linux distributions includes GUI system + GNU utilities (such as cp, mv, ls,date, bash etc) + installation & management tools + GNU c/c++ Compilers + Editors (vi) + and various applications (such as OpenOffice, Firefox).
    - UNIX operating systems are considered as a complete operating system as everything come from a single source or vendor.
- License and cost
  - Linux is free, can redistribute it under GNU licenses.
  - Most UNIX like operating systems are not free (but this is changing fast, foru example OpenSolaris UNIX). However, some Linux distributions such as Redhat / Novell provides additional Linux support, consultancy, bug fixing, and training for additional fees.
- User-Friendly
  - Linux is considered as most user friendly UNIX like operating systems. It makes it easy to install sound card, flash players, and other desktop goodies.

  - HP-UX – /sbin/init.d
  - Linux – /etc/init.d
