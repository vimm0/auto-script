Learning Philosophy

The easy way is the hard way
- learn by doing
- woodworking analogy
- "Tutorial Hell"
- Acually do the things
    - scrimba is ideal for this kind of learning if you use it correctly (https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact)    

Spaced learning and repetition are key
- dont binge the course
- take frequent breaks(rest your brain for the day)
- re-watch past lessons for review
