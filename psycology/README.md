logical reasoning and structured thinking

It’s not that hard actually. Here are some rules

- Always weigh the pros and cons of a situation carefully, and completely leave out emotions whether negative or positive when building an argument. Look at it like at a school essay that you get a grade on based on how well you looked at all the facts from various angles.
Always prioritize the needs of stakeholders from most important to least important, and see if this is something that is very important to that person and if your point of view is very unimportant in comparison. If it is, you have no right to fight over this point, since the priorities are skewed
- Only believe things with insurmountable evidence. Be extremely critical toward all things with zero evidence, weak evidence and also mediocre evidence. Even be critical towards things with strong evidence and very strong evidence. Stop guessing, believing etc. This is the source of all suffering.
- Do not have strong opinions. Many times you have probably heard “Have strong opinions, it makes you look “confident”. That’s bullshit. An intelligent person only has strong opinions if there is insurmountable evidence. They have studied the subject for weeks and months and have practiced critical thinking for months and years. For things where there is no clear overwhelming evidence, they can still have an opinion, but they are cautious with their opinion and are still looking to collect more evidence. But if they have collected lots of evidence and have run it by at least five different people, they have strong opinions. Only people with low education and little ability of critical thinking have many strong opinions.
- Be aware of the major logical fallacies and cognitive biases 90% of people commit hundreds of times every single day. This is not a joke. It really happens that much. If you are aware of these fallacies and know them by heart, your life will completely change. If you know these 3 infographics, you already have an overview of most fallacies that people commit constantly and it gives you a very good starting point.
