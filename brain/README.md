- learnacy,  literacy and numeracy
- Since we cannot know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is senseless to try and teach it in advance. Instead we should try to turn out people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to learn whatever needs to be learned.

Getting Ready to Learn
- “chance favors only the prepared mind,”
- If you are tired or angry, hungry or distressed, too cold or too hot, you will not be in a state to learn.
- The greatest revolution of our generation is the discovery that human beings, by changing the inner attitudes of their minds, can change the outer aspects of their lives.
- It surprises me how our culture can destroy curiosity in the most curious of all animals—human beings.
- It is essential to show emotions, but in a controlled way. You must show passion and belief, but rarely anger. A leader needs to be able to touch people at a raw emotional level.
- People relate to you as a human being. You do need to show emotion, but never fake it. Of course you have to display anger for effect sometimes.
- I don’t think you should show emotions at work. Yet you must obviously be
emotional to make effective relationships. You have therefore, as a leader,
to create a synthetic emotion, but one that is based on your genuine beliefs.
Leadership is about deliberately creating a personality that is the right one
for your company, and as such must involve playing a role. You need to be
an actor, but it’s not an act.
-  “It is the positive emotions that are really important, elation, joy and optimism.”
- It’s very important to show you are really upset by some of the situations I’ve
had to deal with in the oil and rail industries. Normally you must behave
with equanimity, but for real issues, for example involving death, you must
sometimes show your real emotions.
- Try this idea. Take a page from your diary or personal organizer or create an electronic equivalent. Mark it out in hours and draw a line down the middle of the page. Every hour, stop and
jot down on the left-hand side who you are with, where you are, and what you are doing.
Describe on the right-hand side how you are feeling and any observations you might have
about the situation. You can also use this approach in meetings if your attention is wandering!
